        <h4>Programming</h4>
        <p>
            In this project I was apart of a club called the Aztec Game Lab that made a 2D platformer throughout the 
            schools semester. I was mainly apart of the progamming team where I helped create scripts for different
            aspects of the game.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>

        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="images/kap3.jpg">
        </div>

        <p>
            One of the main scripts that I helped to create was the directional wind script, where the audio
            for the wind sound effect would change what headphone it would be playing in. If the player stood
            in the middle it would be equal on both sides but if they passed to the left or right the respective
            headphone would play the audio louder.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>

        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="images/kap1.jpg">
        </div>

        <p>
            Another Script that I helped to create was the coyote time script. With this aspect of the game it
            would in a way simulate coyote who had just chased road runenr off a cliff and hangs in the air for 
            little bit. In the game the player would be able to jump and hang in the air for a little bit if they
            were to aim their projectile. This helped to take out enemies as well as navigate through some levels.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>

        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="images/kap2.jpg">
        </div>

        <p>
            The last script that I helped to create was the paralax effect script. This made it to where parts of
            the level that were closer in the backgound would move faster while objects that were further off in 
            the background would move slower. This enabled the art team to add multiple layers onto the background 
            and the script would register how far they were to the main level and shift them over when the player moved respectfully.

        <h4>Level Design</h4>

        <p>
            In this project I worked in the same club but this semester we worked on a 3D horror game where the player
            had to solve puzzles throughout the level to proceed. I mainly focused on level design this semester where 
            I built levels, designed enemey pathways, and added level ambience. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>

        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="images/pest3.jpg"> <img src="images/pest5.jpg">

        </div>
        
        <p>
            In the games first level I helped place structures that would later become buildings that the art team designed.
            I also added invisible walls around the map to prevent the player from getting stuck or bug the game out. In the
            games final level I made the main foundation for the crypt part of the level where the player first starts out. I 
            also added torches that would light up the level adding to the ambience. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>

        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="images/pest4.jpg" >
        </div>

        <p>
            In the games final level after the crypt, the player goes up into a cathedral. I implemented a jumpscare that would have 
            an enemy yell at the player, this also let the player know there are enemies in the area.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>

        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="images/pest1.jpg"> <img src="images/pest2.jpg">

        </div>

        <p>
            The sewer level in the game I added another jumpscare at the beginning of the level where an enemy would spawn and run past
            the corridor the player is looking at. The enemy would despawn when it either hit the end of its path or when the player would 
            too close to them before the enemy reached the end of its path. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The enemies within the game all have a set path that hey walk with a starting point and end point with other points in the middle
            in order to make sure they walk around obstacles or buildings. I helped design the paths they would walk as well as implemented them
            within the game using another club memebrs well made script that took in set points around the map for different enemies to use to 
            walk around. 
            <br>
            <br>

        <h4>Programming</h4>
        
        <p>
            In this project I was apart of a small group of four people within a game development class
            offered by SDSU. Within this group we were to make a small scale game over the course of a semester. I mainly helped with the level design 
            and the programming aspects of the game. Our game involved the player being able to change their shape in order
            to get the highest score going through each levels obstacles. Each level has different pickups; being coins 
            which give extra points, speed boosts, and slows pads which can help or harm the player. WE offered three difficulties to the game,
            which change the base speed of the player with the hardest difficulties making the player the fastest requiring faster 
            reflexes. If the player isn't able to make it through an obstacle and hits the wall then the player will game over 
            and the score will be displayed.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>

        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="images/hole1.jpg" > <img src="images/hole3.jpg" >
        </div>

        <p>
            I programmed and designed the main menu as well as the character creation menu where the player can set their 
            name, color, and the difficulty of the game. My groupmate did a great job with the art that is added on the main 
            menu and the obstacles in the game, giving the game some flare. The main menu and character creation menus both have
            interactable buttons that have an animation that expands and darkens them to make the menus more responsive.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>

        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="images/hole2.jpg" >
        </div>

        <p>
            As far as the main gameplay I helped design the obstacles that the player had to go through. I made it to where the walls had a kill box which would 
            send the player to the gameover screen if the players hit box came into contact with it. The holes in the walls all have different shapes rewarding the player
            more points if they go through with the correct shape. Using a script that my groupmate made, lets the player change into diffrent shapes
            having to cycle through the different shapes one by one.
